# A VR-oriented game-attraction for a couple of minutes.

The action takes place in the 16th century, during the conquest of Western Siberia. Two Cossacks set out to ferry furs from one island to another along the river and are ambushed by a group of soldiers from the Crimean Khanate.
The player puts on a VR helmet, and after the "enlightenment" screen, is on the river bank in the taiga, he is given a couple of seconds to look around, in the boat is a saber, also the player's back is covered by his companion. In 5-6 seconds a group of enemies comes out of the taiga and surrounds the Cossacks. The player has to use his saber to repel the attack on the cargo.

It's a hackathon project by a team of five people:
* @Wrkor: main code architecture
* @Newddr: level design, code
* @SeeEndX: models, animation
* @mxkmn: game design, team assist, presenter
* @AnotherBore: game design, presenter
